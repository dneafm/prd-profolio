          <p>
            DJ Trade started as an attempt to make dense trading activity easier to monitor, review, and act on. I approached it less like a market dashboard and more like an operational surface: what needs attention now, what changed, what is degraded, and what decision should happen next.
          </p>
          <p>
            The work focused on scanability under pressure, clearer comparison paths, stronger trust signals before execution, and workflow structure that reflects real progress instead of vague status buckets. DJ Trade is where new strategies are forged, tested, and turned into operational workflows. Reports were treated as live workflow objects rather than static outputs, so the interface could support follow-up and judgment instead of just display.
